# Twitter Bots

This is going to be a variety of little side projects
and maybe proof-of-concepts that I play with and use 
to practice some of my basic coding skills, as well as
practice with some new APIs and tool discovery. I 
might end up doing CI/CD practice on these, but that's
far in the future.

1/12/18: daily_color_bot added.
The point of daily_color_bot is to post a tweet every
24 hours with a pseudorandomly generated color's hex
value. It's very simple, and was used as a test to see
how the APIs communicated.
